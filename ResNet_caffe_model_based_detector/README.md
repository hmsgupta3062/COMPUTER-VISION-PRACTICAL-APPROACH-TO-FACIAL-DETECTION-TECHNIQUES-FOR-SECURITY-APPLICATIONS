## ResNet based face detector

### About

The directory contains the python script, resultant output images, model, and documentation for the facial detection technique build using ResNet model. 

### How To Use

The python script uses the Open-Source Computer Vision Framework to deal with the images. The model used is 'ResNet' caffe face detector model and is used to detect the faces present in the 'test_images' folder. 

For using it, place any image in the 'test_images' folder, run the python script and the results, corresponding to the input image, will get displayed as well as stored in the 'image_results' folder.
