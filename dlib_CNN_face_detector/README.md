## dlib CNN Classifier

### About

The directory contains the python script, resultant output images, model, and documentation for the facial detection technique build using CNN based dlib face detection model and dlib shape predictor model. 

### How To Use

The python script uses the Open-Source Computer Vision Framework to deal with the images. The models used are 'mmod_human_face_detector.dat' and 'shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat' classifier and is used to detect the faces present in the 'test_images' folder. 

For using it, place any image in the 'test_images' folder, run the python script and the results, corresponding to the input image, will get displayed as well as stored in the 'image_results' folder.
