##Abstract:

The use of biometrics in the field of security applications has been increased rapidly due to their uniqueness, reliability, universality, wide-acceptability, confidentiality and highly-precised performance factor. With the latest advancements in the technology, various techniques and devices have been developed to read, understand, visualize and record different physical and non physical biometric features of the human body. The results obtained from such devices are processed and analysed through different complex mathematical functions and well-developed algorithms which helps the researchers and concerned organizations to decode the valuable information from them with more precision and accuracy using deep learning and boosting the efficiency and response time by using powerful processing units. Some of the most acceptable and usable biometrics include Fingerprint recognition, Facial recognition, DNA matching, Iris recognition, Voice Matching, etc. All the biometrics involves the use of different techniques and processes so as to be able to read, process, understand, store, visualize and decode. This chapter primarily focuses on the latest algorithms and techniques developed so far, in order to capture and analyze the facial biometrics of the human body. The use of facial biometrics has been widely used and preferred due to its high reliability, security, less complexity, and more efficient performance factors. The facial biometrics, in the field of computer vision, involves 2 different concepts named as Facial detection and Facial recognition whose brief elaborations are too discussed in the chapter. Face detection techniques involves the use of different machine learning and deep learning concepts in order to detect the human faces present in an image whereas the facial recognition systems involves more complex algorithms by adding an extra layer of identifying and labelling the human faces present in the image with the help of their facial landmarks and characteristics. The chapter also includes the brief but clear, precise and descriptive information as well as features of some of the well known facial detection techniques along with the comparative analysis of their respective results and supporting graphics and visualizations. Besides that, the chapter focuses on the monitoring, security and surveillance applications of the facial detection systems too, along with the other relevant fields.
